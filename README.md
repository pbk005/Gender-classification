Gender classification application

A Caffe model is a pre-trained deep learning model that has been created using the Caffe framework, an open-source deep learning library developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC). It is used for training and deploying deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, object detection, and other tasks.

The application prompts the user to upload a photo for prediction. When the Predict button is pressed, the uploaded image is saved locally and analyzed using pre-trained weights and displays the result as either Boy or Girl.
